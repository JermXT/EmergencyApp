Meet Emerpin, an app that optimizes rapid response.
Emerpin, a faster way to response.

Our process is easy
 1) Rapid Recognition - Better Information, Faster
 2) Data Synthesis - Preventing Spam and Verification
 3) Emergency Personnel - Responding to the Emergency
 
 Rapid Recognition - Civilians nearby add a Pin. Civilians can upload text and pictures to describe the problem and the emergency. This allows for evidence collection and location for Emergency Personnel.
 
 Data Synthesis - Multiple Pins are Grouped. Evidence collection. 
  Is this the same emergency, or multiple emergencies? Grouping is the answer
 
 Emergency Personnel - Map with 'Jobs'(Emergency Events) You can read information on the go. Get on the scene, instant response. 
  Collection of Data => Easy to locate, easy to visualize.
  
Community Outreach
  1) Introduce to Schools
  2) Peer-to-peer
  3) Announce at events that are hosted by Emergency Personnel
