# EmergencyApp

Meet Emerpin, the app that is a crowdsourced app which helps authorities know what is happpening where.

Imagine if an earthquake were to happen, and one spot a fire is occuring withut anyone in the building, whereas on the other side of town, a person is dying. How would to authorities know where to go first?
  With Emerpin, the crowd notifies authorities what is occuring where. So instead of letting the person die, they would know to help the person.
